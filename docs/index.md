# Overview
With the impressive recent performance of machine-generated visual content, studying how to create realistic imagery
using traditional and AI-based tools is becoming increasingly important.
This course will introduce students to the theoretical and practical foundations of computer graphics, as well as the
recent advances in generative models to automate the content creation process.
This course is designed to prepare both undergraduate and graduate students to learn how visual content can be created
and to prepare for conducting research in a relevant area.

# Syllabus

## Scope and Topics
This course is divided into three parts.
The first part discusses the fundamentals of graphics, including camera models, rasterization, materials and lighting,
ray-tracing, geometry modeling, and texture modeling.
The second and third part discuss automating the traditional graphics pipeline using artificial intelligence.
The second part focuses on 3D reconstruction, including structure-from-motion, neural radiance fields (NeRF), Gaussian
Splatting, etc. The third part discusses theories and practices of generative models, including generative adversarial
networks (GANs) and diffusion models and their recent applications to 3D content creation. Each of these topics would
involve homework assignments involving individual programming.

## Prerequisites
Students taking this course should be comfortable with mathematical expositions and proofs.
Familiarity with linear algebra, probability, and multivariate calculus is required.
Formally, the students are expected to take (*EECS 281*) and (*MATH 425* or *412* or *EECS 301* or *IOE 265* or *TO 301*)
and (*EECS 351* or *MATH 214* or *MATH 217* or *296* or *417* or *419* or *ROB 101*), or be in graduate standings before registering for this course.
The generative parts of the course will involve significant deep learning and computer vision, including neural network design
and training.
Thus, familiarity with deep learning, especially in the context of computer vision, is highly recommended.

## Difference between 498/598
While all undergraduate and graduate students will join the same lectures, they will be given different
homework assignments or exams. The final grades will be assigned within the two tracks.

## Class Participation
This course expects a great amount of class participation from the students and a significant part of the final grade will be
from the participation.
Specifically, **students are expected to join the lectures in person and participate in in-class discussions**.
Students will be expected to contribute to online Q&As and discussions.


## Lab sessions
T/TH lab sessions will be a more involved version of office hours and interchangeable between the two time slots.
Some of the TAs and instructors will be present to help students with the conceptual and homework-related questions,
including hands-on programming aids.
We hope it will also serve as a bazaar of knowledge where students exchange ideas/information and help each other.

## Piazza
- We will use Piazza for discussions on conceptual and technical questions among classmates.
- We expect the students to actively participate in Piazza discussions, which will be a significant part of the participation score.
- Please check Piazza for already posted questions before posting a new one. Unnecessarily clogging up Piazza makes the platform less usable for everybody.
- Please use Piazza for all communications, private or public, as much as possible.  Others will benefit from answers and discussions on public questions.
- There will be no anonymity. Please be respectful to your classmates.
- Piazza is moderated by the teaching staff.

## Course Policies

### Formatting and Submission
Submissions that do not follow these rules (and any additional ones specified in the homeworks) will get a 0.
- **No handwriting** - LaTeX is not required, but encouraged. Just put some effort into generating a readable PDF.
- **Mark answers on Gradescope** - With a few hundred students, graders will not have time to search for answers.

### Collaboration and External Sources
- **Automated plagiarism detection**: The vast majority of students are honorable. To ensure that honorable behavior is the incentivized behavior, we will run MOSS on the submitted homework.
- **Collaboration with students**: You should never know the specific implementation details of anyone else's homework or see their code. Working in teams and giving general advice about outputs or strategies (e.g., ‘‘if the image is really dark when you merge them together, you probably have screwed up the image mask with the number of images’’) is great. However, pair-programming or sitting next to someone else and debugging their code is not allowed.
- **Consulting outside material**: You can and should turn to other documentation (suggested textbooks, other professors’ lecture notes or slides, documentation from libraries). You may not read a set of code (pseudocode is fine). If you come across code in your search, close the window and don't worry about it.
- **Things you should never worry about**: Reading the documentation for publicly available libraries; clarifying ambiguities and mistakes in assignments, slides, handouts, textbooks, or documentation; discussion the general material; helping with things like cryptic numpy errors that are not related to class but part of the cost of doing business with a library; discussing the assignments to better understand what's expected and general solution strategies; discussing the starter code; discussing general strategies for writing and debugging code.
- **Generative AI**: Tools like ChatGPT are strongly discouraged. We know we can't stop you, however, using them will lead to you getting very little hands-on coding ability from this course and you will struggle on the midterm. The libraries used in this course are industry-standard and it is very helpful to be comfortable with them.

### Late Submissions
Our policy is quite generous. Exceptions will be made in only truly exceptional circumstances by the professor.
- **Late Days** - **6 total** late days across all homeworks. These will be applied automatically, no need to contact us. Homeworks are due by 11:59:59 on the due date. Thus, the late day would start at 12:00:00.
- **Penalty** - If you have 0 late days available, any subsequent late submissions will receive a 10% max score reduction per day. For example, if you submit 3 days late, you can receive at most 70% credit.
- **Late Deadline** - Late submissions will be accepted until a week after the deadline.
- **Project** - No late submissions. Late days and penalties will not be applied. This will be due as late as we can take them while still delivering grades on time.

### Regrades
- **Method** - Please submit regrade requests through Gradescope.
- **Deadline** - Submit regrade requests **within 1 week** of grades being released.
- **Minor Regrades** - Regrade requests that concern minor judgement calls that change the grade by <= 1 point for a problem or by <= 3 points for the whole homework will not be considered. If you believe this may affect your grade at the end of the semester, contact the professor.
